[![Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD](https://github.com/speaktosteve/nextjs-azure-static-web-app-accelerator/actions/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/speaktosteve/nextjs-azure-static-web-app-accelerator/actions/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Its primary goal is to provide a simple Next JS application (using App Routes) along with an example Azure Dev Ops pipeline and GitHub action to provide ability to deploy the app to an [Azure Static Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
